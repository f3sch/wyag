* Write yourself a Git (in C++)!
This is an implementation of the [[https://wyag.thb.lt/]["Write yourself a Git!"]] guide in C++20.
There are a couple of goals I have in mind for this learning project, mainly:
- use C++20 features (no modules, CMake does not support it yet...)
- write passable documentation
- proper error handling
- minimal dependencies (cryptopp, boost.program_options)
